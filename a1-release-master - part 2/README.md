# Assignment 1

See [A1.pdf](A1.pdf) for the assignment specifications.

I altered A1.js, sphere.vs and sphere.js.
I used the distance from the armadillo to compress and expand the sphere as it moves closer to the armadillo model.
As the sphere compresses it changes colours.
At the closest distance it turns violet(shortest wavelength) and as it expands it become Red(largest wavelength).
In between it follows the colours of the rainbow in order violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, red.
